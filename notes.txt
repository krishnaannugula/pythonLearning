noun (name,place,animal) ==> Class

Adjective ==> Attributes 
Adjectives are words that describe or modify another person or thing in the sentence

Verb ==> Methods 
Verbs are words used to describe an action, state, or occurrence, and form the main part of the predicate of a sentence, such as hear, become, happen etc


Class is a blueprint  which contains Attributes and Methods
while object is an execution of that blue print



why to give a self input while calling method as due to below explination

ex:- Employee is a classs
     employeeDetails is a Method with in Employee Class
     getEmployeeDetails is a object which calls Employee Class

    getEmployeeDetails = Employee() # object is instanciated by Employee Class
    getEmployeeDetails= employeeDetails() # callsing method of the Employee class

    # which execute like this when object is instanciated 
    Employee.employeeDetails(getEmployeeDetails) which represents the self declartion in the method of that object.
